## Project description
This is a dice game website that takes a number from 1 to 6 as user input and then compares it with the dice number and tells if the predicted number matches with the dice number. If the predicted number is equal to the number on the first dice it displays a message. And if the predicted number is same as both the number on the dice it displays a different message.
### Page content
The page is divided into different divisions with the name of the game on top followed by the picture of two dice. The dice are designed to display the number when it is rolled by the user. An input field below the dice allows the user to enter their guess as to which number might the dice land on. The corresponding message is allowed to display in a tag below the button.
